# smIRCL
smIRCL is a (sm)all (IRC) (L)ibrary designed to provide core cuntionality for IRCv3 in a lightweight and self-sustaining manner. smIRCL will handle an IRC connection and session state for you with minimal input and output, and can provide a very simple to integrate base for simple bots, whilst exposing the required properties to implement more complex features with ease.

Currently, smIRCL supports the following IRCv3 capabilities out of the box (though you may enable and implement handlers for additional ones):
 - `message-tags`
 - `away-notify`
 - `extended-join`
 - `multi-prefix`
 - `chghost`
